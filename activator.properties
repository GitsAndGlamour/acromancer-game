authorBio=Scala and the surrounding ecosystem are one of our specialities. We are a Typesafe consulting partner, we organize Scalar - a middle-European Scala conference, we do some open-source Scala projects (take a look at Reactive Kafka, MacWire, Bootzooka among others), and first and foremost, more and more of our projects are Scala/Akka/Play/(Angular|React) based.
